## User Guide
### Functionalities offered by Lockr
#### 1. Integrated permission setup
Before we can start locking other apps, this application requires two permissions that have to be granted:
- ‘Display over apps’ - Allows this application to add a lock screen over the UI of the locked apps when we attempt to open the locked apps.
- ‘Usage access’ - Allows this application to see information like how many other applications are there on the current device, list them, and their metadata information like name, how long these apps have been used for, etc. 

'Integrated permission setup' helps the user navigate directly to the permissions page on their device settings rather than searching for these permissions manually.

#### 2. Locking Apps
An app palette that allows the user to select the applications they want to lock. This is the major functionality of the application.

#### 3. Unlocking Apps
A list where each entry represents a locked app. We can update this list by tapping on a list item and the app will be removed from the list, effectively unlocking the application. This functionality allows us to edit our selection of locked apps. 

### Locking an application using Lockr - Tutorial
